# Wide-Field-Deconvolution
Inferring Neural Population Spiking Rate from Wide-Field Calcium Imaging

Details can be found in the accompanying manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.01.930040v1

If you hold wide-field fluorescence recordings, after Df/f, and wish to use this code to find the spiking rate behind each pixel/region, follow the deconv_Dff_data_all_steps_using_continuously_varying.mat.
